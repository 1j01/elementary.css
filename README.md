# elementary.css

[elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) is pretty.

elementary.css is a
[conversion](https://github.com/1j01/postcss-gtk.git) of
elementary OS's
[GTK stylesheet](https://launchpad.net/egtk)
 (since [moved to GitHub](https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet)) to browser CSS.

[**Check out the demo!**](https://1j01.github.io/elementary.css/demo/)

The minified CSS is source-mapped all the way back to the GTK CSS it originated from.
Thanks, [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)!

Published [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elementary.css)
